# Data-Visualisation-Project
This repo contains all the files for the Data Visualisation portfolio task.

You will find:

1. The pbix file with all the visualisations.
2. A demo on how to use PowerBI.
3. The presentation slides.
4. The csv file which contains the ONS dataset which was utilised. The dataset can also be accessed here in its raw format: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/datasets/conceptionstatisticsenglandandwalesreferencetables -2019, however the "Data" csv has been cleaned and it is in the appropriate format for the analysis.
